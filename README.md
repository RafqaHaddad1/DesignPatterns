# üìÑDesign Patterns

A design pattern project typically involves implementing well-established solutions to common software design problems. It focuses on structuring code in a reusable and maintainable way, enhancing software quality and developer productivity. Projects often include identifying appropriate patterns (like Singleton, Observer, or Factory), applying them to specific problem domains (like UI frameworks or database interactions), and documenting their usage for future reference. This approach not only improves code organization but also promotes a standardized way of tackling recurring design challenges across different software components.


Shout-out to [Refactoring Guru]( https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/)! Their website indeed provides clear and insightful explanations of various design patterns with helpful visual diagrams. It's a fantastic resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of software design principles and patterns.

# Project Structure

This is .NET 8.0 frameowrk C# project introducing design patterns.

The project is structured as follows:

- **Class Libraries**: There are three class libraries, each dedicated to a different design pattern category (e.g., Creational, Structural, Behavioral). These libraries contain examples demonstrating various design patterns.
  
- **Main Application**: The main application is the central entry point that links to all classes. It allows users to interactively choose and test each design pattern example using interactive user input.

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash

# Creational Design Patterns

Provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. Helps make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed and represented

## A. Factory Method ~ Creational Design Pattern

The **Factory Method Pattern** provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass while allowing subclasses to determine the specific class or object to instantiatem, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in software design. It's particularly useful when dealing with varying object types or when you want to encapsulate object creation logic

<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/factory-method/solution3-en.png" alt="Factory Method Pattern Solution" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/factory-method/structure-indexed.png" alt="Factory Method Pattern Structure" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
- Abstracts the process of object creation to promote loose coupling.
- Allows subclasses to determine the specific class to instantiate, promoting flexibility.

### üõ†Ô∏è When to Use
- When you don't know the exact types and dependencies of objects your code should work with.
- To extend the internal components of a library or framework.
- When reusing existing objects is more efficient.
- When encapsulating object creation logic.
- For supporting multiple product variations.
- When object initialization is expensive.

### üåç Real-Life Scenario
- Notification System: The notification mode can vary based on user preferences or conditions.


## B. Abstract Factory ~ Creational Design Pattern

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** organizes the creation of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. it provides a flexible way to create families of related objects, allowing for extensibility and consistency in software design. 


<div>
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/abstract-factory/problem-en.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/abstract-factory/structure-indexed.png" alt="Abstract Factory Method Pattern Structure" style="width: 45%;">
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
- Create families of related products (e.g., Chair, Sofa, CoffeeTable) with different variants (e.g., Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco).
- Ensures that products within a family match.
- Defines interfaces for each product type, allowing different variants to implement these interfaces.
- Enables addition of new product families or variants without altering existing code.
- 
### üõ†Ô∏è When to use
- You need to create related objects without depending on concrete classes.
- You want to switch between different types easily while following the same rules.
- Consider implementing the abstract factory method when a class deals with multiple product types.
  
### üåç Real-Life Scenarios
- Developing cross-platform GUI libraries (different platforms require different UI components).
- Handling various database systems (creating database-related objects for different databases).
- Maintaining consistent look and feel across diverse environments (ensuring consistent UI elements).


## C. Builder ~ Creational Design Pattern
Builder lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code. it provides flexibility, reusability, and separation of concerns in complex object creation.

<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/builder/builder-en.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/builder/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

 ### üéØ Purpose
- Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation.
- Allows building different types and representations of an object using the same construction process.
- Enables step-by-step construction with flexibility to call only necessary steps for a specific configuration.
- Different builder classes can implement the same construction steps differently to produce various product representations.

### ü§î When to Use
- When you want to create different representations of a product.
- For constructing composite trees or other complex objects.

### üåç Real-Life Scenario
- In web development, the Builder pattern can be used for creating complex Response objects in a web server.
- Example: Constructing various types of HTTP responses (with different headers, body content, and status codes) based on incoming requests.



## D. Prototype ~ Creational Design Pattern

The **Prototype Pattern** allows you to copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. Instead of building a new object from scratch, you create a copy of an existing object (the prototype) that serves as a blueprint and can be customized as needed. it allows efficient object cloning and flexibility in creating complex objects.

<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/prototype/prototype-comic-2-en.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/prototype/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
- The Prototype pattern solves the problem of creating exact copies of objects by delegating the cloning process to the objects themselves.
- It defines a common interface for cloning (typically with a single `clone` method).
- Cloning an object avoids the issues of external copying and class dependencies.
- Objects of the same class can access each other's private fields during cloning.
  
### ü§î When to Use
- When your code shouldn't depend on the concrete classes of the object you need to copy.
- To reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in initialization.
  
### üåç Real-Life Scenario
- In web development, the Prototype Design Pattern is useful for creating complex user interface components.
- For example, consider a web application that allows users to create custom dashboards. Each dashboard contains widgets (charts, tables, forms) configured by the user.
- Instead of creating each widget from scratch, the application can use prototypes. When a user selects a widget, the application clones the prototype and applies custom configurations.


## E. Singleton ~ Creational Design Pattern

The **Singleton pattern** is a software design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to that instance. Remember, the Singleton pattern ensures a single point of access while managing global resources! 
<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/singleton/singleton.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/singleton/structure-en-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
- Restricts instantiation of a class to a single instance.
- Useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.
- Solves problems related to shared resources, access control, and global state.
- Provides easy access to the single instance.
  
### ü§î When to Use
- When a class should have only one instance shared across clients (e.g., a database object).
- When stricter control over global variables is needed.
  
### üåç Real-Life Scenarios
- **Database Connections**: Manage a single database connection.
- **Configuration Files**: Read configuration settings once and reuse the same instance.
- **Logging**: Implement a logging class with a single point of access.

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation
- Declare all constructors of the class as private to prevent direct instantiation.
- Provide a static method (often named `getInstance`) that returns a reference to the instance.
- The instance is usually stored as a private static variable.
- Lazy initialization: The instance is created when needed (when the static method is first called).
  
### üîÑ Difference between Static and Singleton
- **Static Class**: Cannot be instantiated; all members are static.
- **Singleton Class**: Allows one instance, holds state, and provides global access.
- A Static Class cannot be extended whereas a singleton class can be extended.
- A Static Class cannot be initialized whereas a singleton class can be.
- A Static class is loaded automatically by the CLR when the program containing the class is loaded.

  

# Structural Design Pattern
Concerned with how classes and objects are composed to from larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure does not need to do the same. Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient


## A. Adapter ~ Structural Design Pattern

The **Adapter pattern** allows two incompatible interfaces to collaborate. 
Remember, the Adapter pattern ensures smooth collaboration between systems with different interfaces! 

<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/adapter/solution-en.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/adapter/structure-object-adapter-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
- **Bridge Incompatible Interfaces**: The Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between existing classes with different interfaces.
- **Seamless Integration**: It enables smooth communication between systems without modifying their source code.
- **Real-Life Example**: Imagine integrating a third-party analytics library (expecting JSON) into an app that downloads stock data in XML format. The adapter converts XML data to JSON, ensuring compatibility.

### ü§î When to Use
- When existing code has an incompatible interface with the rest of the system.
- When reusing subclasses lacking common functionality that can't be added to the superclass.
  
### üåç Real-Life Scenario
- **Database Connections**: When working with different databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), an adapter standardizes methods for connecting and querying data.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Useful for integrating libraries or APIs with different interfaces.


## B. Bridge ~ Structural Design Pattern

The **Bridge pattern** allows you to split a large class or closely related classes into two separate hierarchies: abstraction and implementation. Remember, the Bridge pattern promotes modularity and flexibility by separating abstraction and implementation! 

<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/bridge/bridge.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/bridge/structure-en-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

 ### üéØ Purpose
- **Decoupling Abstraction and Implementation**: The Bridge pattern separates the high-level control layer (abstraction) from the actual code that performs operations (implementation).
- **Independently Developed Hierarchies**: Abstraction and implementation can evolve independently.
- **Dynamic Bridge**: The bridge allows changing implementations at runtime.

### ü§î When to Use
- When abstraction and implementation need to vary independently.
- When avoiding a permanent binding between them is essential.
- To manage a proliferation of classes resulting from coupled interfaces.
- When sharing an implementation among multiple objects.
  
### üåü Abstraction and Implementation
- **Abstraction**: Represents the high-level interface that clients interact with. It defines operations without knowing implementation details.
- **Implementation**: Provides the actual functionality. Subclasses (like DarkTheme and LightTheme) implement specific behavior.

### üåç Real-Life Scenarios
- **Remote Control**: Abstraction (remote control) interacts with devices (TV, DVD player) through a bridge.
- **Database Interface**: Abstraction defines standard database operations, while drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL) handle specifics.


## C. Composite ~ Structural Design Pattern

The **Composite pattern** allows you to compose objects into tree structures and work with them as if they were individual objects. Remember, the Composite pattern simplifies working with hierarchical structures by treating compositions and individual elements uniformly! 

<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/composite/problem-en.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/composite/structure-en-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

 ### üéØ Purpose
- **Tree-Like Object Structure**: The Composite pattern represents hierarchical structures where individual objects and compositions (composites) share a common interface.
- **Uniform Treatment**: Client code interacts with both simple and complex elements uniformly.
- **Recursion and Polymorphism**: Conveniently work with complex tree structures using recursion and polymorphism.
- **CompoundGraphic**: A container class that can hold sub-shapes (simple shapes or other compound shapes).
- **Client Code**: Interacts with all shapes through a common interface, unaware of whether it's dealing with a simple shape or a compound shape.
  
### ü§î When to Use
- When implementing tree-like structures (e.g., graphics, file systems).
- When you want consistent treatment of individual elements and compositions.
- When introducing new element types without breaking existing code.

### üåç Real-Life Scenarios
- **Customer Portfolios**: Representing a customer's portfolio in banking applications.
- **Complex GUIs**: Creating GUIs with nested elements treated uniformly.
- **File Systems**: Modeling files and directories.
- **UI Components**: Simplifying manipulation of complex UI components.

## D. Decorator ~ Structural Design Pattern

The **Decorator pattern** allows you to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its original class. Remember, the Decorator pattern enhances flexibility and maintains a clean structure! 


<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/decorator/decorator.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/decorator/solution3-en.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose 
- **Dynamic Behavior Extension**: The Decorator pattern dynamically adds behavior to an object without affecting other instances of the same class.
- **Alternative to Subclassing**: Instead of creating subclasses, decorators wrap the original object.
- **Runtime Adjustments**: Allows adding or removing dependencies during runtime.

### ü§î When to Use
- When assigning extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking existing code.
- When inheritance cannot extend an object's behavior (e.g., final classes).

### üåç Real-Life Scenario
- Enhancing UI components in web development (e.g., spellchecking, auto-completion).
- Initially, a notification library had a `Notifier` class for email notifications.
- As users demanded more types (SMS, Facebook, Slack), subclass explosion occurred.
- Decorator pattern solved this by adding behaviors dynamically using composition.
- Each notification type became a decorator, stacking on the base `Notifier`.

## E. Facade ~ Structural Design Pattern

The Facade design pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, libraries, or frameworks, hiding underlying complexities for easier access to functionalities.

<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/facade/facade.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/facade/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
To provide a straightforward interface for a complex subsystem.

### ü§î When to use
1. **Simplifying API Usage**: Facades can streamline interactions with complex APIs.
2. **Database Operations**: Simplifies database interactions by encapsulating complex operations.

### üåç Real_life Scenario
- Imagine a computer with operations like `startCPU()`, `loadRAM()`, and `readDisk()`. A `ComputerFacade` class could offer a single method, `startComputer()`, that encapsulates these operations.


   
## F. Flyweight ~ Structural Design Pattern

The Flyweight design pattern minimizes memory usage and computational expenses by sharing data among similar objects.
- Flyweight objects are immutable and initialized via constructor parameters.
- They do not expose setters or public fields.
- A factory method maintains a pool of flyweights, reusing or creating them as needed.


<div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/flyweight/flyweight.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/flyweight/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>


### üéØ Purpose
To efficiently manage a large number of fine-grained objects by sharing common data.

### ü§î When to use
- Data Compression: In word processors, each character can be represented as a flyweight object, sharing data needed for rendering. This approach minimizes memory usage.
- Graphics and Image Processing: In graphical applications (e.g., games or image processing software), the flyweight pattern manages graphical elements like textures, sprites, or fonts.
- Data Caching: The flyweight pattern can optimize memory usage and improve performance in data caching and persistence frameworks by sharing common data structures among different entities.
- Large Number of Similar Objects: When you need a large number of similar objects that differ only in a few parameters, the flyweight pattern can help control memory consumption by creating fewer objects and sharing them across.

### üåç Real-Life Scenarios
1. **Text Editors**: Manages character formatting to reduce memory usage.
2. **Web Browsers**: Uses flyweights to prevent loading duplicate images.
3. **String Interning in Java**: Reuses identical string instances to save memory.


## G. Proxy ~ Structural Design Pattern

The **Proxy** design pattern allows you to add an extra layer of control over access to an object. 
1. Proxies can perform tasks like controlling object creation, managing access rights, providing a simplified interface, and adding security checks.
2. Types of proxies include virtual, protection, remote, logging, caching, and smart reference.

   <div>
      <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/proxy/proxy.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/proxy/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
1. Control without clients knowing.
2. Manage object lifecycle.
3. Works even if the object isn't ready or available.
4. Introduce new proxies without changing clients or the service.
5. To control access to an object by acting as an intermediary.


### üåê Different types of proxies and their use cases

### 1. Virtual Proxy
- Acts as a stand-in for expensive-to-create objects.
- Creates the real object only when its functionality is explicitly required (lazy loading).
- Example: A `VirtualImage` class that loads the actual image only when needed for display.

### 2. Protection Proxy
- Controls access to the real object, protecting it from unauthorized access.
- Implements appropriate permissions.
- Example: A `ProtectedFile` class that allows access only to users with the correct password.

### 3. Remote Proxy
- Provides a local representation for an object in a different address space or on a remote server.
- Used in distributed systems to hide the complexity of remote calls.
- Example: A `RemoteDatabase` class handling network communication with a database server.

### 4. Logging Proxy
- Adds logging functionality when accessing an object.
- Tracks the number of times an object's method has been called.
- Example: A `LoggingCalculator` class that logs calculations performed by a calculator.

### 5. Caching Proxy
- Improves performance by holding results of expensive operations.
- Reuses cached results when the same inputs occur again.
- Useful in web development for caching web pages, API calls, or database queries.

# Behavioral Design Pattern
Concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects, they focus on the patterns of communication between classes or objects


## A. Chain of Responsibility ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The **Chain of Responsibility** design pattern allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain. :

<div>
   <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/chain-of-responsibility/chain-of-responsibility.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/chain-of-responsibility/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
1. Provides control over the order of request handling.
2. Decouples classes that send requests from classes that handle them.
3. To handle requests by linking multiple handlers into a chain.

### ü§î When to Use
1. When your program processes requests that can be handled by different handlers.
2. When handling requests in a specific sequence or order is crucial.

### üåç Real-Life Scenarios
1. **Event Handling in Web Development**: Events propagate up the DOM tree until a handler processes them.
2. **Logging Systems**: Log messages pass through handlers responsible for different logging actions.
3. Payment processing systems where a purchase request goes through handlers for different payment types (credit card, PayPal, etc.).


## B. Command ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The **Command Design Pattern** encapsulates a request as an object. It allows for the parameterization of clients with different requests and supports undoable operations‚Äîactions that can be reversed or undone in a system.

<div>
   <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/command/command-en.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/command/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
1. You can control the order of request handling.
2. Decouple classes that invoke operations from classes that perform operations.
   
### ü§î When to Use
1. When your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in various ways. It lets you link several handlers into one chain and upon receiving a request, ‚Äúask‚Äù each handler whether it can process it.
2. When it‚Äôs essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.
   
### üåç Real-Life Scenario
- In web development, the Command pattern can be seen in event handling. When an event occurs, it can be handled by the element that triggered it or be passed up the DOM tree until an element with a corresponding event handler is found.
- In software design, it‚Äôs often used in logging systems where a log message could be passed through multiple handlers, each responsible for a different logging action (e.g., writing to a file, sending an email, etc.).
- In practice, the Command pattern decouples the sender (Invoker) from the receiver (Receiver), allowing for flexibility and reusability in object-oriented software. It's particularly useful when you want to avoid hard-wiring requests directly into classes and need to specify requests at runtime. For example, consider a remote control system for various devices, where each button press corresponds to a different command.


## C. Iterator ~ Behavioral Design Pattern
- Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree‚Ä¶)
<div>
   <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/iterator/iterator-en.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/iterator/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>


## D. Mediator ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The **Mediator Design Pattern** defines an object‚Äîthe mediator‚Äîto centralize communication between various components or objects in a system. By preventing direct interactions between components and having them communicate through the mediator, this pattern promotes loose coupling, better maintainability, and flexibility in system architecture.

<div>
   <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/mediator/mediator.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/mediator/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### **Mediator**: 
   - The Mediator interface defines the communication contract, specifying methods that concrete mediators should implement to facilitate interactions among colleagues. It encapsulates the logic for coordinating and managing interactions between objects, promoting loose coupling and centralizing control over their communication.

### üéØ Purpose
 - The Mediator Design Pattern defines an object‚Äîthe mediator‚Äîto centralize communication between various components or objects in a system. By preventing direct interactions between components and having them communicate through the mediator, this pattern promotes loose coupling, better maintainability, and flexibility in system architecture.


### üåç Real-Life Scenario
- **Classroom Group Project**: In a classroom scenario, each student (colleague) has their tasks but needs to collaborate on a project. The teacher (mediator) acts as the intermediary. Instead of students talking directly to each other, they communicate through the teacher. The teacher manages communication, relaying information back and forth, ensuring effective collaboration without dealing with all the details of each other's work.
-  **Event Management in React**: In web development, the Mediator pattern is seen in event management systems. Components communicate through a central event manager (the mediator) rather than directly with each other. For instance, in React, components update their state based on events without needing to know the inner workings of other components.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: An IDE serves as a mediator between plugins and the core software. The IDE provides a central interface for plugins to extend functionality without modifying the core system directly.


## E. Memento ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to save and restore an object's internal state without revealing its implementation details. It enables capturing the internal state of an object at a particular moment and externalizing this state so that the object can be restored to that state later.

<div>
   <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/memento/memento-en.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/memento/structure3-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### ü§î When to use
- Providing undo/redo functionality in applications.
- Protecting the state of an object from external modification by allowing controlled access to mementos
-  Use the Memento pattern when you want to produce snapshots of the object‚Äôs state to be able to restore a previous state of the object.
-  Use the pattern when direct access to the object‚Äôs fields/getters/setters violates its encapsulation.
  
### üåç Real-Life Scenario
- **Text Editor with Undo Feature**: Building a text editor where each user action (typing, formatting changes) creates a memento. These mementos can be used to revert the editor back to previous states, enabling undo functionality.


## F. Observer ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The Observer Design Pattern defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects (observers) about events that happen to a subject (observable). This pattern promotes loose coupling between subjects and observers, allowing multiple objects to react to changes in the subject's state without needing to know the specifics of each other.

<div>
   <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/observer/observer.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/observer/structure-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üåç Real-Life Scenarios
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Frameworks**: Views (observers) update automatically when the model (subject) changes state.
- **Event Listeners in JavaScript**: Elements (subjects) in a web page notify event handlers (observers) of user interactions like clicks or input changes.
- **WebSocket Connections**: Servers (subjects) notify connected clients (observers) of real-time updates or messages.
- **Notification Systems**: Applications notify users (observers) of events such as new messages, reminders, or updates.

### üåü Software Development Impact
- **Decouples Subject from Observers**: Subjects and observers are independent and interact through defined interfaces, promoting flexibility and easier maintenance.
- **Supports Broadcasting Updates**: Subjects can notify multiple observers simultaneously, ensuring efficient communication of state changes.

## G. State ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The State Design Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if it changes its class. This pattern is useful when an object's behavior depends on its state and needs to change dynamically at runtime without massive conditional statements.
<div>
   <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/state/state-en.png" style="width: 45%;">
    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/state/structure-en-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### ü§î When to Use
- When an object's behavior changes based on its internal state, and these behaviors can vary independently.
- To simplify code that would otherwise be dominated by large conditional statements.

### üåç Real-Life Scenario
Imagine a light switch that has states "On" and "Off":
- **Context**: LightSwitch, which changes its behavior (turning on or off) based on its current state.
- **State Interface**: SwitchState, with methods like `turnOn()` and `turnOff()`.
- **Concrete State Classes**: OnState and OffState, implementing `turnOn()` and `turnOff()` methods accordingly.


## H. Strategy ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The Strategy Design Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows algorithms to vary independently from clients that use them, promoting flexibility and reusability in software design.

</div>

### üéØ Purpose
The Strategy pattern is useful in scenarios such as:
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Choosing different sorting strategies (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort) based on data size or type.
- **Form Validation in Web Development**: Applying validation strategies based on user input (e.g., email validation, password strength validation).

### ü§î When to Use
You should consider using the Strategy pattern when:
- There are multiple algorithms that can be used interchangeably within a system.
- You need to encapsulate algorithms and make them easily swappable without affecting the client code.


## I. Template ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The Template Method Design Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass and allows subclasses to override specific steps. It provides a way to define the structure of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations of certain steps.

</div>

### üéØ Purpose
The Template Method pattern is useful in scenarios such as:
- **Report Generation**: Where a base class defines the overall structure of generating a report (e.g., opening/closing files, formatting headers and footers), while subclasses provide specific implementations for generating different types of reports (e.g., PDF report, HTML report).

### ü§î When to Use
You should consider using the Template Method pattern when:
- You want to define a common algorithm structure across multiple subclasses.
- Subclasses need to customize certain steps of the algorithm without changing the overall structure.


## J. Visitor ~ Behavioral Design Pattern

The Visitor Design Pattern is used to perform operations on a group of similar objects without changing their structure. It allows adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures.

    <img src="https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/visitor/structure-en-indexed.png" style="width: 45%; margin-right: 5%;">
 
</div>

### üéØ Purpose
The primary purpose of the Visitor pattern is:
- **Adding New Operations**: It enables adding new operations or algorithms to a group of objects without altering their classes.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Operations are separated from the object structure, promoting single responsibility and cleaner code.
- **Extensibility**: New operations can be added easily by creating new Visitor implementations without modifying existing objects.

### üåç Real-Life Scenarios
The Visitor pattern finds application in:
- **Web Development**: Manipulating DOM elements with various behaviors without changing their structure.
- **Software Design**: Operating on complex structures such as graphical elements or hierarchical data.
